more occasion to know one another I hope upon familiarity

wisely

_Fal_ Truly mine host I must turn away some of my
followers                                                           5

_Host_ Discard bully Hercules cashier let them wag

_Host_ Thou’rt an emperor Cæsar Keisar and Pheezar
I will entertain Bardolph he shall draw he shall tap said        10
I well bully Hector

_Fal_ Do so good mine host

_Host_ I have spoke let him follow _To Bard_ Let
me see thee froth and lime I am at a word follow    _Exit_

_Fal_ Bardolph follow him A tapster is a good trade             15
an old cloak makes a new jerkin a withered serving-man
a fresh tapster Go adieu

_Bard_ It is a life that I have desired I will thrive

_Pist_ O base Hungarian wight wilt thou the spigot wield

    _Exit Bardolph_                                               20

_Nym_ He was gotten in drink is not the humour
conceited

_Fal_ I am glad I am so acquit of this tinder-box his
thefts were too open his filching was like an unskilful
singer he kept not time                                           25

_Nym_ The good humour is to steal at a minute’s rest

_Pist_ ‘Convey’ the wise it call ‘Steal’ foh a fico
for the phrase

_Fal_ Well sirs I am almost out at heels

_Pist_ Why then let kibes ensue                                 30

_Fal_ There is no remedy I must cony-catch I must
shift

_Pist_ Young ravens must have food

_Fal_ Which of you know Ford of this town

_Pist_ I ken the wight he is of substance good                   35

_Fal_ My honest lads I will tell you what I am about

_Pist_ Two yards and more

_Fal_ No quips now Pistol Indeed I am in the waist
two yards about but I am now about no waste I am
about thrift Briefly I do mean to make love to Ford’s             40
wife I spy entertainment in her she discourses she carves
she gives the leer of invitation I can construe the action
of her familiar style and the hardest voice of her behaviour
to be Englished rightly is ‘I am Sir John Falstaff’s’

_Pist_ He hath studied her will and translated her will          45
out of honesty into English

_Nym_ The anchor is deep will that humour pass

_Fal_ Now the report goes she has all the rule of her
husband’s purse he hath a legion of angels

_Pist_ As many devils entertain and ‘To her boy’ say I         50

_Nym_ The humour rises it is good humour me the
angels

_Fal_ I have writ me here a letter to her and here
another to Page’s wife who even now gave me good eyes
too examined my parts with most judicious œillades                55
sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot sometimes
my portly belly

_Pist_ Then did the sun on dunghill shine

_Nym_ I thank thee for that humour

_Fal_ O she did so course o’er my exteriors with such             60
a greedy intention that the appetite of her eye did seem to
scorch me up like a burning-glass Here’s another letter
to her she bears the purse too she is a region in Guiana
all gold and bounty I will be cheaters to them both and
they shall be exchequers to me they shall be my East               65
and West Indies and I will trade to them both Go bear
thou this letter to Mistress Page and thou this to Mistress
Ford we will thrive lads we will thrive

_Pist_ Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become
And by my side wear steel then Lucifer take all                  70

_Nym_ I will run no base humour here take the
humour-letter I will keep the haviour of reputation

_Fal_ _To Robin_ Hold sirrah bear you these letters tightly
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores
Rogues hence avaunt vanish like hailstones go                  75
Trudge plod away o’ the hoof seek shelter pack
Falstaff will learn the humour of the age
French thrift you rogues myself and skirted page

    _Exeunt Falstaff and Robin_

_Pist_ Let vultures gripe thy guts for gourd and fullam holds
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor                        80
Tester I’ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack
Base Phrygian Turk

_Nym_ I have operations which be humours of revenge

_Pist_ Wilt thou revenge

_Nym_ By welkin and her star                                      85

_Pist_ With wit or steel

_Nym_ With both the humours I
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page

_Pist_ And I to Ford shall eke unfold
  How Falstaff varlet vile                                        90
His dove will prove his gold will hold
  And his soft couch defile

_Nym_ My humour shall not cool I will incense Page
to deal with poison I will possess him with yellowness for
the revolt of mine is dangerous that is my true humour            95

_Pist_ Thou art the Mars of malecontents I second
thee troop on    _Exeunt_

ACT II


SCENE I _Before PAGE’S house_

  _Enter MISTRESS PAGE with a letter_

  Transcriber’s Note
  In order to preserve the marked line breaks without losing
  readability each line of the quoted letter has been split into
  two equal halves

_Mrs Page_ What have I scaped love-letters in the
holiday-time of my beauty and am I now a subject for
them Let me see    _Reads_

  ‘Ask me no reason why I love you
  for though Love use Reason
  for his physician he admits him
  not for his counsellor You are                                    5
  not young no more am I go to
  then there’s sympathy you are
  merry so am I ha ha then there’s
  more sympathy you love sack
  and so do I would you desire better
  sympathy Let it suffice thee
  Mistress Page--at the least if the
  love of soldier can suffice--that
  I love thee I will not say pity
  me--’tis not a soldier-like phrase                              10
  but I say love me By me

    Thine own true knight
    By day or night
    Or any kind of light
    With all his might                                              15
    For thee to fight     JOHN FALSTAFF’

What a Herod of Jewry is this O wicked wicked world
One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show himself
a young gallant What an unweighed behaviour hath
this Flemish drunkard picked--with the devil’s name--out           20
of my conversation that he dares in this manner assay me
Why he hath not been thrice in my company What
should I say to him I was then frugal of my mirth
Heaven forgive me Why I’ll exhibit a bill in the
parliament for the putting down of men How shall I be revenged     25
on him for revenged I will be as sure as his guts
are made of puddings

  _Enter MISTRESS FORD_

_Mrs Ford_ Mistress Page trust me I was going to
your house

_Mrs Page_ And trust me I was coming to you You                 30
look very ill

_Mrs Ford_ Nay I’ll ne’er believe that I have to show
to the contrary

_Mrs Page_ Faith but you do in my mind

_Mrs Ford_ Well I do then yet I say I could show              35
you to the contrary O Mistress Page give me some
counsel

_Mrs Page_ What’s the matter woman

_Mrs Ford_ O woman if it were not for one trifling respect
I could come to such honour                                        40

_Mrs Page_ Hang the trifle woman take the honour
What is it--dispense with trifles--what is it

_Mrs Ford_ If I would but go to hell for an eternal
moment or so I could be knighted

_Mrs Page_ What thou liest Sir Alice Ford These                 45
knights will hack and so thou shouldst not alter the article
of thy gentry

_Mrs Ford_ We burn daylight--here read read perceive
how I might be knighted I shall think the worse of
fat men as long as I have an eye to make difference of             50
men’s liking and yet he would not swear praised women’s
modesty and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof
to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition
would have gone to the truth of his words but they do no
more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth              55
Psalm to the tune of ‘Green Sleeves’ What tempest I
trow threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his
belly ashore at Windsor How shall I be revenged on
him I think the best way were to entertain him with
hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own       60
grease Did you ever hear the like

_Mrs Page_ Letter for letter but that the name of
Page and Ford differs To thy great comfort in this mystery
of ill opinions here’s the twin-brother of thy letter
but let thine inherit first for I protest mine never shall      65
I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters writ with
blank space for different names--sure more--and these
are of the second edition he will print them out of doubt
for he cares not what he puts into the press when he would
put us two I had rather be a giantess and lie under               70
Mount Pelion Well I will find you twenty lascivious turtles
ere one chaste man

_Mrs Ford_ Why this is the very same the very hand
the very words What doth he think of us

_Mrs Page_ Nay I know not it makes me almost                     75
ready to wrangle with mine own honesty I’ll entertain
myself like one that I am not acquainted withal for sure
unless he know some strain in me that I know not myself
he would never have boarded me in this fury

_Mrs Ford_ ‘Boarding’ call you it I’ll be sure to keep           80
him above deck

_Mrs Page_ So will I if he come under my hatches
I’ll never to sea again Let’s be revenged on him let’s
appoint him a meeting give him a show of comfort in his
suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay till he hath        85
pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter

_Mrs Ford_ Nay I will consent to act any villany
against him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty
O that my husband saw this letter it would give
eternal food to his jealousy                                       90

_Mrs Page_ Why look where he comes and my
good man too he’s as far from jealousy as I am from
giving him cause and that I hope is an unmeasurable
distance

_Mrs Ford_ You are the happier woman                              95

_Mrs Page_ Let’s consult together against this greasy
knight Come hither    _They retire_

  _Enter FORD with PISTOL and PAGE with NYM_

_Ford_ Well I hope it be not so

_Pist_ Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs
Sir John affects thy wife                                         100

_Ford_ Why sir my wife is not young

_Pist_ He wooes both high and low both rich and poor
Both young and old one with another Ford
He loves the gallimaufry Ford perpend

_Ford_ Love my wife                                              105

_Pist_ With liver burning hot Prevent or go thou
Like Sir Actæon he with Ringwood at thy heels
O odious is the name

_Ford_ What name sir

_Pist_ The horn I say Farewell                                 110
Take heed have open eye for thieves do foot by night
Take heed ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing
Away Sir Corporal Nym--
Believe it Page he speaks sense    _Exit_

_Ford_ _Aside_ I will be patient I will find out this         115

_Nym_ _To Page_ And this is true I like not the humour
of lying He hath wronged me in some humours
I should have borne the humoured letter to her but I
have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity He
loves your wife there’s the short and the long My name           120
is Corporal Nym I speak and I avouch ’tis true my
name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife Adieu I
love not the humour of bread and cheese and there’s the
humour of it Adieu    _Exit_

_Page_ ‘The humour of it’ quoth ’a here’s a fellow              125
frights English out of his wits

_Ford_ I will seek out Falstaff

_Page_ I never heard such a drawling affecting rogue

_Ford_ If I do find it--well

_Page_ I will not believe such a Cataian though the              130
priest o’ the town commended him for a true man

_Ford_ ’Twas a good sensible fellow--well

_Page_ How now Meg

    _Mrs Page and Mrs Ford come forward_

_Mrs Page_ Whither go you George Hark you

_Mrs Ford_ How now sweet Frank why art thou melancholy         135

_Ford_ I melancholy I am not melancholy Get you
home go

_Mrs Ford_ Faith thou hast some crotchets in thy
head Now will you go Mistress Page                             140

_Mrs Page_ Have with you You’ll come to dinner
George _Aside to Mrs Ford_ Look who comes yonder
she shall be our messenger to this paltry knight

_Mrs Ford_ _Aside to Mrs Page_ Trust me I thought on
her she’ll fit it                                                145

  _Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY_

_Mrs Page_ You are come to see my daughter Anne

_Quick_ Ay forsooth and I pray how does good Mistress
Anne

_Mrs Page_ Go in with us and see we have an hour’s
talk with you                                                     150

    _Exeunt Mrs Page Mrs Ford and Mrs Quickly_

_Page_ How now Master Ford

_Ford_ You heard what this knave told me did you not

_Page_ Yes and you heard what the other told me

_Ford_ Do you think there is truth in them

_Page_ Hang ’em slaves I do not think the knight                155
would offer it but these that accuse him in his intent
towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men very
rogues now they be out of service

_Ford_ Were they his men

_Page_ Marry were they                                          160

_Ford_ I like it never the better for that Does he lie
at the Garter

_Page_ Ay marry does he If he should intend this
voyage toward my wife I would turn her loose to him and
what he gets more of her than sharp words let it lie on my        165
head

_Ford_ I do not misdoubt my wife but I would be loath
to turn them together A man may be too confident I
would have nothing lie on my head I cannot be thus
satisfied                                                         170

_Page_ Look where my ranting host of the Garter
comes there is either liquor in his pate or money in his
purse when he looks so merrily

  _Enter HOST_

How now mine host

_Host_ How now bully-rook thou’rt a gentleman                  175
Cavaleiro-justice I say

  _Enter SHALLOW_

_Shal_ I follow mine host I follow Good even and
twenty good Master Page Master Page will you go with
us we have sport in hand

_Host_ Tell him cavaleiro-justice tell him bully-rook         180

_Shal_ Sir there is a fray to be fought between Sir
Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor

_Ford_ Good mine host o’ the Garter a word with you
    _Drawing him aside_

_Host_ What sayest thou my bully-rook

_Shal_ _To Page_ Will you go with us to behold it My           185
merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons and
I think hath appointed them contrary places for believe
me I hear the parson is no jester Hark I will tell you
what our sport shall be    _They converse apart_

_Host_ Hast thou no suit against my knight my
guest-cavaleire                                                   190

_Ford_ None I protest but I’ll give you a pottle of
burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him my
name is Brook only for a jest

_Host_ My hand bully thou shalt have egress and                 195
regress--said I well--and thy name shall be Brook It is
a merry knight Will you go An-heires

_Shal_ Have with you mine host

_Page_ I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in
his rapier                                                        200

_Shal_ Tut sir I could have told you more In these
times you stand on distance your passes stoccadoes and
I know not what ’tis the heart Master Page ’tis here ’tis
here I have seen the time with my long sword I would
have made you four tall fellows skip like rats                    205

_Host_ Here boys here here shall we wag

_Page_ Have with you I had rather hear them scold
than fight    _Exeunt Host Shal and Page_

_Ford_ Though Page be a secure fool and stands so
firmly on his wife’s frailty yet I cannot put off my opinion      210
so easily she was in his company at Page’s house and
what they made there I know not Well I will look
further into’t and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff If
I find her honest I lose not my labour if she be otherwise
’tis labour well bestowed    _Exit_                             215

to gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and
tall fellows and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of          10
her fan I took’t upon mine honour thou hadst it not

_Pist_ Didst not thou share hadst thou not fifteen

throng--To your manor of Pickt-hatch Go You’ll not

honour Why thou unconfinable baseness it is as much as
I can do to keep the terms of my honour precise I I I            20
myself sometimes leaving the fear of God on the left hand
and hiding mine honour in my necessity am fain to shuffle
to hedge and to lurch and yet you rogue will ensconce

phrases and your bold-beating oaths under the shelter of          25
your honour You will not do it you

rushling I warrant you in silk and gold and in such alligant
terms and in such wine and sugar of the best and the
fairest that would have won any woman’s heart and I
warrant you they could never get an eye-wink of her I             65
had myself twenty angels given me this morning but
I defy all angels--in any such sort as they say--but in the
way of honesty and I warrant you they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all
and yet there has been earls nay which is more pensioners       70
but I warrant you all is one with her

_Fal_ But what says she to me be brief my good she-Mercury

to your worship Mistress Page hath her hearty
commendations to you too and let me tell you in your
ear she’s as fartuous a civil modest wife and one I tell
you that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer as          90

woman so dote upon a man surely I think you have
charms la yes in truth                                          95

_Quick_ Blessing on your heart for’t

_Fal_ But I pray thee tell me this has Ford’s wife

Page would desire you to send her your little page

little page and truly Master Page is an honest man             105
Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does
do what she will say what she will take all pay all go to
bed when she list rise when she list all is as she will and
truly she deserves it for if there be a kind woman in
Windsor she is one You must send her your page no               110

_Ford_ Bless you sir

_Fal_ And you sir Would you speak with me                      140

_Ford_ I make bold to press with so little preparation
upon you

_Fal_ You’re welcome What’s your will--Give us
leave drawer    _Exit Bardolph_

_Ford_ Sir I am a gentleman that have spent much                145
my name is Brook

_Fal_ Good Master Brook I desire more acquaintance
of you

_Ford_ Good Sir John I sue for yours not to charge
you for I must let you understand I think myself in better        150
plight for a lender than you are the which hath something
emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion for they say
if money go before all ways do lie open

_Fal_ Money is a good soldier sir and will on

_Ford_ Troth and I have a bag of money here troubles             155
me if you will help to bear it Sir John take all or half for
easing me of the carriage

_Fal_ Sir I know not how I may deserve to be your
porter

_Ford_ I will tell you sir if you will give me the hearing     160

_Fal_ Speak good Master Brook I shall be glad to be
your servant

_Ford_ Sir I hear you are a scholar--I will be brief with
you--and you have been a man long known to me though
I had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted    165
with you I shall discover a thing to you wherein
I must very much lay open mine own imperfection but
good Sir John as you have one eye upon my follies as you
hear them unfolded turn another into the register of your
own that I may pass with a reproof the easier sith you           170
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender

_Fal_ Very well sir proceed

_Ford_ There is a gentlewoman in this town her husband’s
name is Ford

_Fal_ Well sir                                                  175

_Ford_ I have long loved her and I protest to you bestowed
much on her followed her with a doting observance
engrossed opportunities to meet her fee’d every slight occasion
that could but niggardly give me sight of her not only
bought many presents to give her but have given largely to        180
many to know what she would have given briefly I have
pursued her as love hath pursued me which hath been on
the wing of all occasions But whatsoever I have merited
either in my mind or in my means meed I am sure I have
received none unless experience be a jewel that I have            185
purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to
say this
  ‘Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues
  Pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues’

_Fal_ Have you received no promise of satisfaction at             190
her hands

_Ford_ Never

_Fal_ Have you importuned her to such a purpose

_Ford_ Never

_Fal_ Of what quality was your love then                        195

_Ford_ Like a fair house built on another man’s ground
so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where
I erected it

_Fal_ To what purpose have you unfolded this to me

_Ford_ When I have told you that I have told you all            200
Some say that though she appear honest to me yet in
other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is
shrewd construction made of her Now Sir John here is
the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent
breeding admirable discourse of great admittance authentic      205
in your place and person generally allowed for your
many war-like court-like and learned preparations

_Fal_ O sir

_Ford_ Believe it for you know it There is money
spend it spend it spend more spend all I have only             210
give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay
an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford’s wife use
your art of wooing win her to consent to you if any man
may you may as soon as any

_Fal_ Would it apply well to the vehemency of your                215
affection that I should win what you would enjoy Methinks
you prescribe to yourself very preposterously

_Ford_ O understand my drift She dwells so securely
on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul
dares not present itself she is too bright to be looked           220
against Now could I come to her with any detection in
my hand my desires had instance and argument to commend
themselves I could drive her then from the ward of
her purity her reputation her marriage-vow and a thousand
other her defences which now are too too strongly                225
embattled against me What say you to’t Sir John

_Fal_ Master Brook I will first make bold with your
money next give me your hand and last as I am a gentleman
you shall if you will enjoy Ford’s wife

_Ford_ O good sir                                                230

_Fal_ I say you shall

_Ford_ Want no money Sir John you shall want none

_Fal_ Want no Mistress Ford Master Brook you shall
want none I shall be with her I may tell you by her
own appointment even as you came in to me her assistant         235
or go-between parted from me I say I shall be with
her between ten and eleven for at that time the jealous
rascally knave her husband will be forth Come you to me
at night you shall know how I speed

_Ford_ I am blest in your acquaintance Do you know              240
Ford sir

_Fal_ Hang him poor cuckoldly knave I know him not
--yet I wrong him to call him poor they say the jealous
wittolly knave hath masses of money for the which his wife
seems to me well-favoured I will use her as the key of the        245
cuckoldly rogue’s coffer and there’s my harvest-home

_Ford_ I would you knew Ford sir that you might
avoid him if you saw him

_Fal_ Hang him mechanical salt-butter rogue I will
stare him out of his wits I will awe him with my cudgel          250
it shall hang like a meteor o’er the cuckold’s horns Master
Brook thou shalt know I will predominate over the
peasant and thou shalt lie with his wife --Come to me
soon at night Ford’s a knave and I will aggravate his
style thou Master Brook shalt know him for knave and            255
cuckold Come to me soon at night      _Exit_

_Ford_ What a damned Epicurean rascal is this My
heart is ready to crack with impatience Who says this is
improvident jealousy my wife hath sent to him the hour
is fixed the match is made Would any man have thought            260
this See the hell of having a false woman My bed
shall be abused my coffers ransacked my reputation gnawn
at and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong but
stand under the adoption of abominable terms and by him
that does me this wrong Terms names--Amaimon                    265
sounds well Lucifer well Barbason well yet they are
devils’ additions the names of fiends but Cuckold
Wittol--Cuckold the devil himself hath not such a name Page
is an ass a secure ass he will trust his wife he will not
be jealous I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter          270
Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese an Irishman
with my aqua-vitæ bottle or a thief to walk my ambling
gelding than my wife with herself then she plots then
she ruminates then she devises and what they think in
their hearts they may effect they will break their hearts         275
but they will effect God be praised for my jealousy--Eleven
o’clock the hour I will prevent this detect my
wife be revenged on Falstaff and laugh at Page I will
about it better three hours too soon than a minute too
late Fie fie fie cuckold cuckold cuckold   _Exit_         280

  _Enter FALSTAFF_

_Fal_ ‘Have I caught’ thee ‘my heavenly jewel’ Why
now let me die for I have lived long enough this is the
period of my ambition O this blessed hour

_Mrs Ford_ O sweet Sir John

_Fal_ Mistress Ford I cannot cog I cannot prate                 40
Mistress Ford Now shall I sin in my wish I would thy
husband were dead I’ll speak it before the best lord
I would make thee my lady

_Mrs Ford_ I your lady Sir John alas I should be a
pitiful lady                                                       45

_Fal_ Let the court of France show me such another I
see how thine eye would emulate the diamond thou hast
the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the ship-tire
the tire-valiant or any tire of Venetian admittance

_Mrs Ford_ A plain kerchief Sir John my brows become             50
nothing else nor that well neither

_Fal_ By the Lord thou art a traitor to say so thou
wouldst make an absolute courtier and the firm fixture of thy
foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled
farthingale I see what thou wert if Fortune thy foe               55
were not Nature thy friend Come thou canst not hide it

_Mrs Ford_ Believe me there’s no such thing in me

_Fal_ What made me love thee let that persuade thee
there’s something extraordinary in thee Come I cannot
cog and say thou art this and that like a many of these           60
lisping hawthorn-buds that come like women in men’s apparel
and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time I cannot
but I love thee none but thee and thou deservest it

_Mrs Ford_ Do not betray me sir I fear you love
Mistress Page                                                      65

_Fal_ Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
Counter-gate which is as hateful to me as the reek of a
lime-kiln

_Mrs Ford_ Well heaven knows how I love you and
you shall one day find it                                          70

_Fal_ Keep in that mind I’ll deserve it

_Mrs Ford_ Nay I must tell you so you do or else I
could not be in that mind

_Rob_ _Within_ Mistress Ford Mistress Ford here’s
Mistress Page at the door sweating and blowing and               75
looking wildly and would needs speak with you presently

_Fal_ She shall not see me I will ensconce me behind
the arras

_Mrs Ford_ Pray you do so she’s a very tattling
woman    _Falstaff hides himself_                                80

  _Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN_

with all the officers in Windsor to search for a gentleman
that he says is here now in the house by your consent to
take an ill advantage of his absence you are undone               95

_Mrs Ford_ ’Tis not so I hope

_Mrs Page_ Pray heaven it be not so that you have
such a man here but ’tis most certain your husband’s coming
with half Windsor at his heels to search for such a one
I come before to tell you If you know yourself clear             100
why I am glad of it but if you have a friend here convey
convey him out Be not amazed call all your senses to
you defend your reputation or bid farewell to your good
life for ever

_Mrs Ford_ What shall I do There is a gentleman                  105

as his peril I had rather than a thousand pound he were
out of the house

_Mrs Page_ For shame never stand ‘you had rather’
and ‘you had rather’ your husband’s here at hand bethink         110
you of some conveyance in the house you cannot
hide him O how have you deceived me Look here is a
basket if he be of any reasonable stature he may creep
in here and throw foul linen upon him as if it were going
to bucking or--it is whiting-time--send him by your two         115
men to Datchet-mead

_Mrs Ford_ He’s too big to go in there What shall
I do

_Fal_ _Coming forward_ Let me see’t let me see’t

counsel --I’ll in

_Mrs Page_ Is there not a double excellency in this              155

_Mrs Ford_ I know not which pleases me better that
my husband is deceived or Sir John

_Mrs Page_ What a taking was he in when your husband
asked who was in the basket

_Mrs Ford_ I am half afraid he will have need of washing         160
so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit

_Mrs Page_ Hang him dishonest rascal I would all of
the same strain were in the same distress

_Mrs Ford_ I think my husband hath some special suspicion
of Falstaff’s being here for I never saw him so gross             165
in his jealousy till now

_Mrs Page_ I will lay a plot to try that and we will
yet have more tricks with Falstaff his dissolute disease
will scarce obey this medicine

_Mrs Ford_ Shall we send that foolish carrion Mistress           170
Quickly to him and excuse his throwing into the water
and give him another hope to betray him to another punishment

_Mrs Page_ We will do it let him be sent for to-morrow
eight o’clock to have amends                                     175

_Fent_ I see I cannot get thy father’s love
Therefore no more turn me to him sweet Nan

_Anne_ Alas how then

_Fent_               Why thou must be thyself
He doth object I am too great of birth
And that my state being gall’d with my expense                     5
I seek to heal it only by his wealth
Besides these other bars he lays before me--
My riots past my wild societies
And tells me ’tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property                               10

_Anne_ May be he tells you true

_Fent_ No heaven so speed me in my time to come
Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth
Was the first motive that I woo’d thee Anne
Yet wooing thee I found thee of more value                        15
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags
And ’tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at

_Anne_          Gentle Master Fenton
Yet seek my father’s love still seek it sir
If opportunity and humblest suit                                    20

_Fal_ Bardolph I say--

_Bard_ Here sir

_Fal_ Go fetch me a quart of sack put a toast in’t _Exit
Bard_ Have I lived to be carried in a basket like a barrow
of butcher’s offal and to be thrown in the Thames Well            5
if I be served such another trick I’ll have my brains ta’en
out and buttered and give them to a dog for a new-year’s
gift The rogues slighted me into the river with as little
remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch’s puppies
fifteen i’ the litter and you may know by my size                  10
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking if the bottom
were as deep as hell I should down I had been drowned
but that the shore was shelvy and shallow--a death that
I abhor for the water swells a man and what a thing
should I have been when I had been swelled I should                15
have been a mountain of mummy

  _Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack_

_Bard_ Here’s Mistress Quickly sir to speak with you

_Fal_ Come let me pour in some sack to the Thames
water for my belly’s as cold as if I had swallowed snow-balls
for pills to cool the reins Call her in                           20

_Bard_ Come in woman

  _Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY_

_Quick_ By your leave I cry you mercy give your
worship good morrow

_Fal_ Take away these chalices Go brew me a pottle
of sack finely                                                     25

_Bard_ With eggs sir

_Fal_ Simple of itself I’ll no pullet-sperm in my brewage
_Exit Bardolph_ How now

_Quick_ Marry sir I come to your worship from Mistress
Ford                                                               30

_Fal_ Mistress Ford I have had ford enough I was
thrown into the ford I have my belly full of ford

_Quick_ Alas the day good heart that was not her
fault she does so take on with her men they mistook
their erection                                                     35

_Fal_ So did I mine to build upon a foolish woman’s
promise

_Quick_ Well she laments sir for it that it would yearn
your heart to see it Her husband goes this morning
a-birding she desires you once more to come to her                 40
between eight and nine I must carry her word quickly
she’ll make you amends I warrant you

_Fal_ Well I will visit her tell her so and bid her
think what a man is let her consider his frailty and then
judge of my merit                                                  45

_Quick_ I will tell her

_Fal_ Do so Between nine and ten sayest thou

_Quick_ Eight and nine sir

_Fal_ Well be gone I will not miss her

_Quick_ Peace be with you sir    _Exit_                        50

_Fal_ I marvel I hear not of Master Brook he sent me
word to stay within I like his money well --O here he
comes

  _Enter FORD_

_Ford_ Bless you sir

_Fal_ Now Master Brook--you come to know what                    55
hath passed between me and Ford’s wife

_Ford_ That indeed Sir John is my business

_Fal_ Master Brook I will not lie to you I was at her
house the hour she appointed me

_Ford_ And sped you sir                                          60

_Fal_ Very ill-favouredly Master Brook

_Ford_ How so sir Did she change her determination

_Fal_ No Master Brook but the peaking Cornuto her
husband Master Brook dwelling in a continual ’larum of
jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after           65
we had embraced kissed protested and as it were spoke
the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of
his companions thither provoked and instigated by his
distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife’s
love                                                               70

_Ford_ What while you were there

_Fal_ While I was there

_Ford_ And did he search for you and could not find
you

_Fal_ You shall hear As good luck would have it                  75
comes in one Mistress Page gives intelligence of Ford’s
approach and in her invention and Ford’s wife’s distraction
they conveyed me into a buck-basket

_Ford_ A buck-basket

_Fal_ By the Lord a buck-basket--rammed me in with               80
foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins
that Master Brook there was the rankest compound
of villanous smell that ever offended nostril

_Ford_ And how long lay you there

_Fal_ Nay you shall hear Master Brook what I have               85
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good Being
thus crammed in the basket a couple of Ford’s knaves his
hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the
name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane they took me on their
shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door          90
who asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket I quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would
have searched it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold
held his hand Well on went he for a search and
away went I for foul clothes But mark the sequel Master           95
Brook I suffered the pangs of three several deaths first
an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in
the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head
and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with       100
stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of
that--a man of my kidney--think of that--that am as
subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution
and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation And in
the height of this bath when I was more than half stewed          105
in grease like a Dutch dish to be thrown into the Thames
and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a horse-shoe
think of that--hissing hot--think of that Master Brook

_Ford_ In good sadness sir I am sorry that for my sake
you have suffered all this My suit then is desperate           110
you’ll undertake her no more

_Fal_ Master Brook I will be thrown into Etna as I
have been into Thames ere I will leave her thus Her
husband is this morning gone a-birding I have received
from her another embassy of meeting ’twixt eight and              115
nine is the hour Master Brook

_Ford_ ’Tis past eight already sir

_Fal_ Is it I will then address me to my appointment
Come to me at your convenient leisure and you
shall know how I speed and the conclusion shall be                120
crowned with your enjoying her Adieu You shall have
her Master Brook Master Brook you shall cuckold Ford
    _Exit_

_Ford_ Hum ha is this a vision is this a dream do
I sleep Master Ford awake awake Master Ford there’s
a hole made in your best coat Master Ford This ’tis to           125
be married this ’tis to have linen and buck-baskets
Well I will proclaim myself what I am I will now take
the lecher he is at my house he cannot ’scape me ’tis
impossible he should he cannot creep into a halfpenny
purse nor into a pepper-box but lest the devil that guides      130
him should aid him I will search impossible places
Though what I am I cannot avoid yet to be what I would
not shall not make me tame if I have horns to make
one mad let the proverb go with me--I’ll be horn-mad

SCENE II _A room in FORD’S house_

  _Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD_

_Fal_ Mistress Ford your sorrow hath eaten up my
sufferance I see you are obsequious in your love and
I profess requital to a hair’s breadth not only Mistress
Ford in the simple office of love but in all the accoutrement
complement and ceremony of it But are you sure                     5
of your husband now

_Mrs Ford_ He’s a-birding sweet Sir John

_Mrs Page_ _Within_ What ho gossip Ford what ho

_Mrs Ford_ Step into the chamber Sir John

    _Exit Falstaff_

  _Enter MISTRESS PAGE_

_Mrs Page_ How now sweetheart who’s at home besides              10
yourself

_Mrs Ford_ Why none but mine own people

_Mrs Page_ Indeed

_Mrs Ford_ No certainly _Aside to her_ Speak louder

_Mrs Page_ Truly I am so glad you have nobody here               15

_Mrs Ford_ Why

_Mrs Page_ Why woman your husband is in his old
lunes again he so takes on yonder with my husband so
rails against all married mankind so curses all Eve’s
daughters of what complexion soever and so buffets himself        20
on the forehead crying ‘Peer out peer out’ that any
madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness civility
and patience to this his distemper he is in now I am glad
the fat knight is not here

_Mrs Ford_ Why does he talk of him                               25

_Mrs Page_ Of none but him and swears he was carried
out the last time he searched for him in a basket
protests to my husband he is now here and hath drawn
him and the rest of their company from their sport to make
another experiment of his suspicion but I am glad the              30
knight is not here now he shall see his own foolery

_Mrs Ford_ How near is he Mistress Page

_Mrs Page_ Hard by at street end he will be here anon

_Mrs Ford_ I am undone--the knight is here

_Mrs Page_ Why then you are utterly shamed and                  35
he’s but a dead man What a woman are you--Away
with him away with him better shame than murder

_Mrs Ford_ Which way should he go how should I
bestow him Shall I put him into the basket again

  _Re-enter FALSTAFF_

_Fal_ No I’ll come no more i’ the basket May I not               40
go out ere he come

_Mrs Page_ Alas three of Master Ford’s brothers watch
the door with pistols that none shall issue out otherwise
you might slip away ere he came But what make you
here                                                               45

_Fal_ What shall I do--I’ll creep up into the chimney

_Mrs Ford_ There they always use to discharge their
birding-pieces Creep into the kiln-hole

_Fal_ Where is it

_Mrs Ford_ He will seek there on my word Neither                 50
press coffer chest trunk well vault but he hath an abstract
for the remembrance of such places and goes to
them by his note there is no hiding you in the house

_Fal_ I’ll go out then

_Mrs Page_ If you go out in your own semblance you                55
die Sir John Unless you go out disguised--

_Mrs Ford_ How might we disguise him

_Mrs Page_ Alas the day I know not There is no
woman’s gown big enough for him otherwise he might put
on a hat a muffler and a kerchief and so escape                 60

_Fal_ Good hearts devise something any extremity
rather than a mischief

_Mrs Ford_ My maid’s aunt the fat woman of Brentford
has a gown above

_Mrs Page_ On my word it will serve him she’s as big             65
as he is and there’s her thrummed hat and her muffler
too Run up Sir John

_Mrs Ford_ Go go sweet Sir John Mistress Page and
I will look some linen for your head

_Mrs Page_ Quick quick we’ll come dress you straight            70
put on the gown the while    _Exit Falstaff_

_Mrs Ford_ I would my husband would meet him in
this shape he cannot abide the old woman of Brentford
he swears she’s a witch forbade her my house and hath
threatened to beat her                                             75

_Mrs Page_ Heaven guide him to thy husband’s cudgel
and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards

_Mrs Ford_ But is my husband coming

_Mrs Page_ Ay in good sadness is he and talks of
the basket too howsoever he hath had intelligence                 80

_Mrs Ford_ We’ll try that for I’ll appoint my men to
carry the basket again to meet him at the door with it as
they did last time

_Mrs Page_ Nay but he’ll be here presently let’s go
dress him like the witch of Brentford                              85

_Mrs Ford_ I’ll first direct my men what they shall do
with the basket Go up I’ll bring linen for him straight
    _Exit_

_Mrs Page_ Hang him dishonest varlet we cannot misuse
him enough
We’ll leave a proof by that which we will do                      90
Wives may be merry and yet honest too
We do not act that often jest and laugh
’Tis old but true--Still swine eat all the draff    _Exit_

  _Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two SERVANTS_

_Mrs Ford_ Go sirs take the basket again on your
shoulders your master is hard at door if he bid you set it        95
down obey him quickly dispatch    _Exit_

_First Serv_ Come come take it up

_Sec Serv_ Pray heaven it be not full of knight again

_First Serv_ I hope not I had as lief bear so much lead

  _Enter FORD PAGE SHALLOW CAIUS and SIR HUGH EVANS_

_Ford_ Ay but if it prove true Master Page have you            100

_Evans_ Why this is lunatics this is mad as a mad
dog                                                               110

_Shal_ Indeed Master Ford this is not well indeed

_Mrs Ford_ If you find a man there he shall die a flea’s
death

_Page_ Here’s no man                                             135

_Shal_ By my fidelity this is not well Master Ford

_Evans_ Master Ford you must pray and not follow the
imaginations of your own heart this is jealousies

_Ford_ Well he’s not here I seek for                            140

_Page_ No nor nowhere else but in your brain

_Ford_ Help to search my house this one time If I
find not what I seek show no colour for my extremity let
me for ever be your table-sport let them say of me ‘As
jealous as Ford that searched a hollow walnut for his wife’s      145
leman’ Satisfy me once more once more search with me

_Mrs Ford_ What ho Mistress Page come you and the
old woman down my husband will come into the chamber

she We are simple men we do not know what’s brought

killed the poor woman

_Mrs Ford_ Nay he will do it ’Tis a goodly credit for
you

_Ford_ Hang her witch

_Evans_ By yea and no I think the ’oman is a witch indeed       170
I like not when a ’oman has a great peard I spy a
great peard under his muffler

_Ford_ Will you follow gentlemen I beseech you
follow see but the issue of my jealousy if I cry out thus
upon no trail never trust me when I open again                   175

_Page_ Let’s obey his humour a little further come
gentlemen    _Exeunt Ford Page Shal Caius and Evans_

_Mrs Page_ Trust me he beat him most pitifully

_Mrs Ford_ Nay by the mass that he did not he beat
him most unpitifully methought                                    180

_Mrs Page_ I’ll have the cudgel hallowed and hung
o’er the altar it hath done meritorious service

_Mrs Ford_ What think you may we with the warrant
of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience pursue
him with any further revenge                                      185

_Mrs Page_ The spirit of wantonness is sure scared
out of him if the devil have him not in fee-simple with
fine and recovery he will never I think in the way of
waste attempt us again

_Mrs Ford_ Shall we tell our husbands how we have                 190
served him

_Mrs Page_ Yes by all means if it be but to scrape
the figures out of your husband’s brains If they can find
in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any
further afflicted we two will still be the ministers             195

_Mrs Ford_ I’ll warrant they’ll have him publicly
shamed and methinks there would be no period to the
jest should he not be publicly shamed

_Mrs Page_ Come to the forge with it then shape it
I would not have things cool    _Exeunt_                        200

SCENE IV _A room in FORD’S house_

  _Enter PAGE FORD MISTRESS PAGE MISTRESS FORD
  and SIR HUGH EVANS_

_Evans_ ’Tis one of the best discretions of a ’oman as
ever I did look upon

_Page_ And did he send you both these letters at an
instant

_Mrs Page_ Within a quarter of an hour                             5

_Ford_ Pardon me wife Henceforth do what thou wilt
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness now doth thy honour stand
In him that was of late an heretic
As firm as faith

_Page_         ’Tis well ’tis well no more                      10
Be not as extreme in submission
As in offence
But let our plot go forward let our wives
Yet once again to make us public sport
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow                         15
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it

_Ford_ There is no better way than that they spoke of

_Page_ How to send him word they’ll meet him in the
Park at midnight Fie fie he’ll never come

_Evans_ You say he has been thrown in the rivers and              20
has been grievously peaten as an old ’oman methinks
there should be terrors in him that he should not come
methinks his flesh is punished he shall have no desires

_Page_ So think I too

_Mrs Ford_ Devise but how you’ll use him when he comes            25
And let us two devise to bring him thither

_Mrs Page_ There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest
Doth all the winter-time at still midnight
Walk round about an oak with great ragg’d horns                   30
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner
You have heard of such a spirit and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld                                   35
Receiv’d and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth

_Page_ Why yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Herne’s oak
But what of this

_Mrs Ford_     Marry this is our device                          40
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us

_Page_ Well let it not be doubted but he’ll come
And in this shape when you have brought him thither
What shall be done with him what is your plot

_Mrs Page_ That likewise have we thought upon and thus           45
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth we’ll dress
Like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
And rattles in their hands upon a sudden                          50
As Falstaff she and I are newly met
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song upon their sight
We two in great amazedness will fly
Then let them all encircle him about                               55
And fairy-like to-pinch the unclean knight
And ask him why that hour of fairy revel
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane

_Mrs Ford_ And till he tell the truth
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound                           60
And burn him with their tapers

_Mrs Page_                   The truth being known
We’ll all present ourselves dis-horn the spirit
And mock him home to Windsor

_Ford_                     The children must
Be practised well to this or they’ll ne’er do’t

_Evans_ I will teach the children their behaviours and            65
I will be like a jack-an-apes also to burn the knight with
my taber

_Ford_ That will be excellent I’ll go and buy them
vizards

_Mrs Page_ My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies           70
Finely attired in a robe of white

_Page_ That silk will I go buy _Aside_ And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
And marry her at Eton Go send to Falstaff straight

_Ford_ Nay I’ll to him again in name of Brook                    75
He’ll tell me all his purpose sure he’ll come

_Mrs Page_ Fear not you that Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies

_Evans_ Let us about it it is admirable pleasures and
fery honest knaveries    _Exeunt Page Ford and Evans_          80

_Mrs Page_ Go Mistress Ford
Send quickly to Sir John to know his mind

    _Exit Mrs Ford_

I’ll to the doctor he hath my good will
And none but he to marry with Nan Page
That Slender though well landed is an idiot                      85
And he my husband best of all affects
The doctor is well money’d and his friends
Potent at court he none but he shall have her
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her    _Exit_

life and I paid nothing for it neither but was paid for
my learning

_Bard_ Run away with the cozeners for so soon as I
came beyond Eton they threw me off from behind one of

_Fal_ I would all the world might be cozened for I
have been cozened and beaten too If it should come to
the ear of the court how I have been transformed and how
my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled they
would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor                90

And as I am a gentleman I’ll give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss                         5

_Host_ I will hear you Master Fenton and I will at
the least keep your counsel

_Fent_ From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page
Who mutually hath answer’d my affection                            10
So far forth as herself might be her chooser
Even to my wish I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter
That neither singly can be manifested                              15
Without the show of both fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene the image of the jest
I’ll show you here at large Hark good mine host
To-night at Herne’s oak just ’twixt twelve and one
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen                          20
The purpose why is here in which disguise
While other jests are something rank on foot
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry she hath consented                           25
Now sir
Her mother even strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away
While other sports are tasking of their minds
And at the deanery where a priest attends
Straight marry her to this her mother’s plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor Now thus it rests
Her father means she shall be all in white                         35
And in that habit when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go
She shall go with him her mother hath intended
The better to denote her to the doctor--
For they must all be mask’d and vizarded--                         40
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed
With ribands pendent flaring ’bout her head
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
To pinch her by the hand and on that token
The maid hath given consent to go with him                         45

_Host_ Which means she to deceive father or mother

_Fent_ Both my good host to go along with me
And here it rests--that you’ll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church ’twixt twelve and one
And in the lawful name of marrying                                50
To give our hearts united ceremony

_Host_ Well husband your device I’ll to the vicar
Bring you the maid you shall not lack a priest

_Fent_ So shall I evermore be bound to thee
Besides I’ll make a present recompense    _Exeunt_              55

’tis no matter better a little chiding than a great deal of

Jove thou wast a bull for thy Europa love set
on thy horns O powerful love that in some respects
makes a beast a man in some other a man a beast You               5
were also Jupiter a swan for the love of Leda O omnipotent
Love how near the god drew to the complexion of a
goose--A fault done first in the form of a beast--O Jove
a beastly fault And then another fault in the semblance
of a fowl--think on’t Jove a foul fault When gods have          10
hot backs what shall poor men do For me I am here a
Windsor stag and the fattest I think i’ the forest Send

kissing-comfits and snow eringoes let there come a tempest
of provocation I will shelter me here                             20

_Mrs Ford_ Mistress Page is come with me sweetheart

_Fal_ Divide me like a bribe buck each a haunch I

  _Enter SIR HUGH EVANS disguised as before PISTOL as Hobgoblin
  MISTRESS QUICKLY ANNE PAGE and others as Fairies with tapers_

_Quick_ Fairies black grey green and white                    35
You moonshine revellers and shades of night
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny
Attend your office and your quality
Crier Hobgoblin make the fairy oyes

_Pist_ Elves list your names silence you airy toys             40
Cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap
Where fires thou find’st unraked and hearths unswept
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery

_Fal_ They are fairies he that speaks to them shall die          45
I’ll wink and couch no man their works must eye
    _Lies down upon his face_

_Evans_ Where’s Bede Go you and where you find a maid
That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said
Raise up the organs of her fantasy
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy                             50
But those as sleep and think not on their sins
Pinch them arms legs backs shoulders sides and shins

_Quick_ About about
Search Windsor Castle elves within and out
Strew good luck ouphes on every sacred room                      55
That it may stand till the perpetual doom
In state as wholesome as in state ’tis fit
Worthy the owner and the owner it
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower                       60
Each fair instalment coat and several crest
With loyal blazon evermore be blest
And nightly meadow-fairies look you sing
Like to the Garter’s compass in a ring
Th’ expressure that it bears green let it be                      65
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see
And _Honi soit qui mal y pense_ write
In emerald tufts flowers purple blue and white
Like sapphire pearl and rich embroidery
Buckled below fair knighthood’s bending knee                       70
Fairies use flowers for their charactery
Away disperse but till ’tis one o’clock
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter let us not forget

_Evans_ Pray you lock hand in hand yourselves in order set      75
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be
To guide our measure round about the tree--
But stay I smell a man of middle-earth

_Fal_ Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy lest he
transform me to a piece of cheese                                  80

_Pist_ Vile worm thou wast o’erlook’d even in thy birth

_Quick_ With trial-fire touch me his finger-end
If he be chaste the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain but if he start
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart                               85

_Pist_ A trial come

_Evans_             Come will this wood take fire

    _They burn him with their tapers_

_Fal_ Oh Oh Oh

_Quick_ Corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire
About him fairies sing a scornful rhyme
And as you trip still pinch him to your time                     90

  SONG

    Fie on sinful fantasy
    Fie on lust and luxury
    Lust is but a bloody fire
    Kindled with unchaste desire
    Fed in heart whose flames aspire                              95
    As thoughts do blow them higher and higher
    Pinch him fairies mutually
    Pinch him for his villany
  Pinch him and burn him and turn him about
  Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out                 100

_During this song they pinch FALSTAFF DOCTOR CAIUS comes

  _Enter PAGE FORD MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD_

_Page_ Nay do not fly I think we have watch’d you now
Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn

_Mrs Page_ I pray you come hold up the jest no higher
Now good Sir John how like you Windsor wives
See you these husband do not these fair yokes                    105
Become the forest better than the town

_Ford_ Now sir who’s a cuckold now Master Brook
Falstaff’s a knave a cuckoldly knave here are his horns
Master Brook and Master Brook he hath enjoyed nothing
of Ford’s but his buck-basket his cudgel and twenty              110
pounds of money which must be paid to Master Brook
his horses are arrested for it Master Brook

_Mrs Ford_ Sir John we have had ill luck we could
never meet I will never take you for my love again but
I will always count you my deer                                   115

_Fal_ I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass

_Ford_ Ay and an ox too both the proofs are extant

_Fal_ And these are not fairies I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the
guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my powers           120
drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief in
despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason that they
were fairies See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent
when ’tis upon ill employment

_Evans_ Sir John Falstaff serve Got and leave your              125
desires and fairies will not pinse you

_Ford_ Well said fairy Hugh

_Evans_ And leave you your jealousies too I pray you

_Ford_ I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
able to woo her in good English                                   130

_Fal_ Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it that
it wants matter to prevent so gross o’erreaching as this
Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too shall I have a coxcomb
of frize Tis time I were choked with a piece of
toasted cheese                                                    135

_Evans_ Seese is not good to give putter your pelly is
all putter

_Fal_ ‘Seese’ and ’putter’ have I lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English This is enough
to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm        140

_Mrs Page_ Why Sir John do you think though we
would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and
shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell
that ever the devil could have made you our delight

_Ford_ What a hodge-pudding a bag of flax                      145

_Mrs Page_ A puffed man

_Page_ Old cold withered and of intolerable entrails

_Ford_ And one that is as slanderous as Satan

_Page_ And as poor as Job

_Ford_ And as wicked as his wife                                 150

_Evans_ And given to fornications and to taverns and
sack and wine and metheglins and to drinkings and
swearings and starings pribbles and prabbles

_Fal_ Well I am your theme you have the start of
me I am dejected I am not able to answer the Welsh               155
flannel ignorance itself is a plummet o’er me use me as
you will

_Ford_ Marry sir we’ll bring you to Windsor to one
Master Brook that you have cozened of money to whom
you should have been a pander over and above that you             160
have suffered I think to repay that money will be a biting
affliction

_Page_ Yet be cheerful knight thou shalt eat a posset
to-night at my house where I will desire thee to laugh at
my wife that now laughs at thee tell her Master Slender          165
hath married her daughter

_Mrs Page_ _Aside_ Doctors doubt that if Anne Page
be my daughter she is by this Doctor Caius’ wife

  _Enter SLENDER_

_Slen_ Whoa ho ho father Page

_Page_ Son how now how now son have you                       170
dispatched

_Slen_ Dispatched--I’ll make the best in Gloucestershire
know on’t would I were hanged la else

_Page_ Of what son

_Slen_ I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne               175
Page and she’s a great lubberly boy If it had not been
i’ the church I would have swinged him or he should have
swinged me If I did not think it had been Anne Page
would I might never stir--and ’tis a postmaster’s boy

_Page_ Upon my life then you took the wrong                    180

_Slen_ What need you tell me that I think so when
I took a boy for a girl If I had been married to him for
all he was in woman’s apparel I would not have had him

_Page_ Why this is your own folly Did not I tell you
how you should know my daughter by her garments                   185

_Slen_ I went to her in white and cried ‘mum’ and she
cried ‘budget’ as Anne and I had appointed and yet it
was not Anne but a postmaster’s boy

_Mrs Page_ Good George be not angry I knew of
your purpose turned my daughter into green and indeed          190
she is now with the doctor at the deanery and there

  _Enter CAIUS_

_Caius_ Vere is Mistress Page By gar I am cozened

is not Anne Page by gar I am cozened                            195

_Mrs Page_ Why did you take her in green

_Caius_ Ay by gar and ’tis a boy by gar I’ll raise all
Windsor    _Exit_

_Ford_ This is strange Who hath got the right Anne

_Page_ My heart misgives me--here comes Master                   200
Fenton

  _Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE_

How now Master Fenton

_Anne_ Pardon good father good my mother pardon

_Page_ Now mistress how chance you went not with
Master Slender                                                    205

_Mrs Page_ Why went you not with master doctor maid

_Fent_ You do amaze her hear the truth of it
You would have married her most shamefully
Where there was no proportion held in love
The truth is she and I long since contracted                    210
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
The offence is holy that she hath committed
And this deceit loses the name of craft
Of disobedience or unduteous title
Since therein she doth evitate and shun                            215
A thousand irreligious cursed hours
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her

_Ford_ Stand not amazed here is no remedy
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state
Money buys lands and wives are sold by fate                      220

_Fal_ I am glad though you have ta’en a special stand
to strike at me that your arrow hath glanced

_Page_ Well what remedy Fenton heaven give thee joy
What cannot be eschew’d must be embraced                          225

_Fal_ When night-dogs run all sorts of deer are chased

_Mrs Page_ Well I will muse no further Master Fenton
Heaven give you many many merry days
Good husband let us every one go home
And laugh this sport o’er by a country fire                       230
Sir John and all

_Ford_         Let it be so Sir John
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
For he to-night shall lie with Mistress Ford    _Exeunt_

NOTES


NOTE I

I 1 41 Master Page is called ‘George’ in three places II 1 135 and
143 and V 5 189 but we have left the text of the Folios uncorrected
as the mistake may have been Shakespeare’s own It is however possible
that a transcriber or printer may have mistaken ‘Geo’ for ‘Tho’

In I 3 89 90 on the other hand we have not hesitated to correct the
reading of the Folio substituting ‘Page’ for ‘Ford’ and ‘Ford’ for
‘Page’ because as the early Quartos have the names right it seems
likely that the blunder was _not_ due to Shakespeare


NOTE II

I 1 49 Here again as in line 40 F2 F3 F4 read ‘good’ F1 Q3 ‘goot’
but we have not thought it necessary to do more than give a specimen of
such variations Capell in order to make Dr Caius’s broken English
consistent with itself corrects it throughout and substitutes ‘de’ for
‘the’ ‘vill’ for ‘will’ and so forth As a general rule we have
silently followed the first Folio


NOTE III

I 1 114 With regard to this and other passages which Pope Theobald
Malone &c have inserted from the early Quartos our rule has been to
introduce between brackets such and such only as seemed to be
absolutely essential to the understanding of the text taking care to
give in the note all those which we have rejected

The fact that so many omissions can be supplied from such mutilated
copies as the early Quartos indicates that there may be many more
omissions for the detection of which we have no clue The text of the
_Merry Wives_ given in F1 was probably printed from a carelessly written
copy of the author’s MS


NOTE IV

I 3 95 Perhaps as in the _Two Gentlemen of Verona_ III 1 315 and
other passages some of which are mentioned by Sidney Walker in his
‘Criticisms’ Vol II p 13 sqq this vexed passage may be emended by
supplying a word We venture to suggest ’the revolt of mine _anger_ is
dangerous’ The recurrence of the same letters +anger+ in the word
‘dangerous’ might mislead the printer’s eye and cause the omission


NOTE V

II 1 5 In the copy of Johnson’s Edition which belongs to Emmanuel
College there is a MS note of Dr Farmer’s referring to Sonnet CXLVII
in support of the conjecture ‘physician’ for ‘precisian’ we find there

  ‘My reason the physician to my love’ &c


NOTE VI

II 1 194 196 Here again we have followed the early Quartos in
reading ‘Brook’ instead of ‘Broome’ the name given by Ff Q3 That the
former was the original name is proved by the jest in II 2 136 where
the Folios make sheer nonsense

Mr Halliwell suggests that the following lines IV 4 75 76

  ’Nay I’ll to him again in name of Broome
  He’ll tell me all his purpose sure he’ll come’

were intended to rhyme and therefore favour the later reading But in
this scene there are no rhyming lines except the couplet at the end

On the whole it seems likely that the name was altered in the stage
copies at the instance of some person of the name of Brook living at
Windsor who had sufficient acquaintance with the players or interest
with their patrons to get it done


NOTE VII

III 1 74 78 Mr Staunton is unquestionably right in supposing that
one part of Evans’s speech is spoken aside to his opponent and the
other part aloud It is impossible else to account for the sudden change
of tone It might have been conjectured that being a parson he wished
to appear peacefully minded and therefore made his offers of
reconciliation aloud and his menaces in an under tone but Caius’s reply
shews that it was the threat which had been made aloud Evans’s valour
it would seem had already evaporated when he had ‘a great dispositions
to cry’ III 1 20 and besides he had just begun to see that he was
being made a laughing-stock As his former speech 74 75 is also
conciliatory it was probably spoken so as to be heard by Caius only He
wished to keep up his credit for courage in the eyes of the bystanders
In the corresponding scene of the first Quartos we have the words ‘Hark
van urd in your ear’ and the meaning of the text may have been obscured
by some omission in the Folio


NOTE VIII

IV 4 41 No doubt there is an omission here in the Folio which may be
partly supplied from the Quarto But it is probable that Mrs Ford gave a
still fuller explanation of her device and the grounds on which the
disguise was recommended to Falstaff otherwise Page would not have been
so confident of his falling into the snare


NOTE IX

IV 5 49 In the edition of 1778 Steevens reads ‘Ay sir Tike like’
 but it is clear from Farmer’s note that it should be ‘Ay sir Tike’
 and so it is corrected in the later Editions of Steevens In the
Edition annotated by Fanner mentioned in note V we find another
conjecture of his ‘Ay sir if you like’  or it may have been ‘Ay
sir an you like’ for the word preceding ‘you’ has been cut away by the
binder


NOTE X

The stage direction of the early Quartos is _Enter Sir Hugh like a
Satyre and boyes drest like Fayries Mistresse Quickly like the Queene
of Fayries they sing a song about him and afterward speake_

The Folio enumerates at the commencement of the scene all who take part
in it including _Anne Page_ _Fairies_ _Quickly_ and _Pistol_ and in
this place has merely _Enter Fairies_ Malone introduced _Anne Page as
the Fairy Queen_ and at the end _with waxen tapers on their heads_ He
however still assigned the speeches 35-39 53-74 82-85 and 88-90 to
_Quickly_ Recent Editors have generally given them to _Anne_ on the
ground that it is proved by IV 6 20 and V 3 11 12 that she was to
‘present the Fairy Queen’ and that the character of the speeches is
unsuitable to Mrs Quickly It has been argued too that the _Qui_ of
the folios line 35 may be a misprint for _Qu_ ie _Queen_ This
however is contradicted by the fact that Mrs Quickly plays the Queen in
the early Quartos and that the recurrence of _Qui_ line 88 proves
that the printer of the first Folio used either _Qui_ or _Qu_
indifferently as the abbreviation of _Quickly_

Most likely in this and other respects the play was altered by its
author but the stage MSS were not corrected throughout with sufficient
care This will account for the mistake about the colours ‘green’ and
‘white’ in the final scene lines 186 190 196

Or we may suppose Mrs Quickly to have agreed to take Anne’s part in
order to facilitate her escape with Fenton

Of her honestie that she is too bright to be looked
Against Now could I come against her
With some detection I should sooner perswade her
From her marriage vow and a hundred such nice
Tearmes that sheele stand vpon                                    115

_Fal_ Why would it apply well to the veruensie of your affection
That another should possesse what you would enjoy
Meethinks you prescribe verie preposterously

_For_ Want no mony syr _Iohn_ you shall want none

_Fal_ Want no misteris _Ford_ M _Brooke_
You shall want none Euen as you came to me
Her spokes mate her go between parted from me                    130
I may tell you M _Brooke_ I am to meet her
Betweene 8 and 9 for at that time the Iealous
Cuckally knaue her husband wil be from home

_Ford_ Sir do you know _Ford_

_Fal_ Hang him poore cuckally knaue I know him not
And yet I wrong him to call him poore For they
Say the cuckally knaue hath legions of angels
For the which his wife seemes to me well fauored                  140
And Ile vse her as the key of the cuckally knaues
Coffer and there’s my randeuowes

_Foord_ Meethinkes sir it were good that you knew
_Ford_ that you might shun him

_Fal_ Hang him cuckally knaue Ile stare him                      145
Out of his wits Ile keepe him in awe
With this my cudgell It shall hang like a meator
Ore the wittolly knaues head M _Brooke_ thou shalt
See I will predominate ore the peasant
And thou shalt lie with his wife M _Brooke_                      150
Thou shalt know him for knaue and cuckold
Come to me soone at night

    _Exit Falstaffe_

My wife hath sent for him the plot is laid
_Page_ is an Asse a foole A secure Asse                         155
Ile sooner trust an Irishman with my
Aquauita bottle Sir _Hu_ our parson with my cheese
A theefe to walke my ambling gelding then my wife
With her selfe then she plots then she ruminates
And what she thinkes in her hart she may effect                   160
Sheele breake her hart but she will effect it
God be praised God be praised for my iealousie
Well Ile go preuent him the time drawes on
Better an houre too soone then a minit too late
Gods my life cuckold cuckold                                     165

Crammed like a good bilbo in the circomference
Of a pack Hilt to point heele to head and then to                70

But shall stand vnder the taunt of names
_Lucifer_ is a good name _Barbason_ good good
Diuels names but cuckold wittold godeso                          95
The diuel himselfe hath not such a name

Giue them their charge _Puck_ ere they part away

_Fen_ Married to me nay sir neuer storme

_{F}ord_ Ifaith M _Page_ neuer chafe your selfe
She hath made her choise wheras her hart was fixt                 145
Then tis in vaine for you to storme or fret

_Fal_ _I_ am glad yet that your arrow hath glanced

_Mi For_ Come mistris _Page_ Ile be bold with you
Tis pitie to part loue that is so true

_Mis Pa_ Altho that I haue missed in my intent                  150

But since your choise is made of one you loue
Here take her _{F}enton_ & both happie proue                     160

_Sir Hu_ _I_ wil also dance & eate plums at your weddings

_For_ All parties pleased now let vs in to feast

To waite vpon you so God giue you ioy                            165
And sir _Iohn Falstaffe_ now shal you keep your word
For _Brooke_ this night shall lye with mistris _Ford_

    _Exit omnes_
